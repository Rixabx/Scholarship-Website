  <i><h1 align = "center"> TIPS & TRICKS TO CRACK ANY BANKING EXAM EXAM</h1></i>
  <hr>
<H3>1. Know the Bank Exams Syllabus and Exam Pattern:
Aspirants should consider having the knowledge of the whole bank exam syllabus and also be aware of the order in which the questions are expected. It is imperative for candidates to have a fair knowledge of the bank exam pattern including both Mains and Prelims exams.
<BR><br>
2. Create a Study Plan:
Once the online application procedure is done, the candidates should start off with their bank exam preparation. A timetable in which time slots for every subject that is in the bank exams syllabus should be created. This should be done regardless of the fact if the candidate is a student or a working professional, a timetable must be followed with the dedication and adherence to crack the bank exams in the first attempt.
<BR><br>
  3.  Use Best Resources for Bank Exam Preparation:Choosing the right bank exam books can either make or break a candidateâ€™s bank exam preparation. This is because there is no time that can be wasted on looking for another source of preparation once the candidate has already initiated his/her bank exam preparation. So, it is recommended that the candidate should carefully select the most relevant resources, books or study materials for preparation.

<BR><br>
4. Learn smart ways:
Competitive exams demand candidates to answer a lot of questions in a relatively short time. Therefore, it is important that you study a few tricks and short-cuts to solve problems in s shorter time span. In the IAS exam, this is particularly important for the CSAT paper.
  <BR><br>
    5.  Stay Calm And Focused:
The candidates during the time of exam should stay relaxed and focused, as this has proved to improve the concentration level of the candidate.
